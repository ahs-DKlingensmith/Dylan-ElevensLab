Activity 8 Questions

1. The games Elevens, Tens, and Thirteens utilize a board to play, but each game has a different sized board (9, 13, and 10 cards, respectively). All games require the player to remove 
cards from the board in specific pairs or combinations, but these vary between games. For Elevens, pairs that value 11 and combinations of King-Queen-Jack are to be removed. For Tens,
pairs that value 10 and combinations of four matching face cards are to be removed. For Thirteens, pairs that value 13 and single Kings are to be removed. All games are won when the
entire deck is cleared of cards, and are lost when no other plays are possible.

2. The code in the ElevensBoard class implements the abstract methods of the abstract Board class and "overrides" them to perform the necessary actions of Elevens.

3. The isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible methods are the abstract methods in the Board class, but these two methods alone do not cover all difference between the three games 
   (i.e. board size).
